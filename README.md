
# Social Media Feed Backend for University & Corporate Galleries

## Project Overview

PhotoCampus is a modern photo gallery platform designed to revolutionize how universities and companies share and preserve memories. Our primary goal is to abolish traditional paper-based yearbooks by providing a digital alternative that's more accessible, interactive, and environmentally friendly.

This backend solution focuses on creating a scalable GraphQL API that supports high-volume photo collections, user interactions, and targeted content delivery. Unlike general social media platforms, PhotoCampus is specifically tailored for educational institutions and corporate environments, making it easier to find and connect with classmates, colleagues, and alumni.

-   Allow photo studios to showcase their professional work
-   Organize photos by universities, departments, graduating classes, and events

### ðŸ‘¥ User Access & Interaction

-   Public university pages accessible to all users
-   Private company/organization pages accessible via invitation only
-   Comment, like, and share functionality with social media integration
-   User-friendly compared to general social media platforms

### ðŸ”„ Connectivity & Business Features

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

-   **Backend Framework**: Django
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL
-   **API Layer**: GraphQL with Graphene
-   **Testing Interface**: GraphQL Playground
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication

### Database Schema

The database is optimized for high-volume photo storage and user interactions:

-   Users and profiles with permission levels
-   Universities and companies as organization entities
-   Photo collections with metadata and privacy settings
-   Comments, likes, and shares with efficient counter caching
-   Invitations and access control mechanisms

### GraphQL Implementation

Our GraphQL API enables:

-   Flexible querying of photos with filter options
-   Complex data fetching in a single request
-   Real-time updates for user interactions
-   Schema-defined API that's self-documenting


## GraphQL Playground

The API includes a hosted GraphQL Playground for easy testing and exploration:

-   Interactive documentation of the entire schema
-   Real-time query composition and execution
-   Authentication testing capabilities
-   Shareable query collections for team collaboration
